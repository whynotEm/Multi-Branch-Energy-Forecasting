📈 Multi-Branch Deep Learning Model for Energy Consumption Forecasting
This repository contains a hybrid deep learning framework for energy consumption forecasting based on a multi-branch neural network architecture. The model integrates convolutional, recurrent, and dense representations to capture different aspects of temporal and local energy patterns.

🧠 Model Architecture
The model consists of three parallel branches:

🔹 Branch A (CNN): Extracts local temporal features using Conv1D.

🔹 Branch B (LSTM): Captures sequential dependencies through LSTM.

🔹 Branch C (Dense): Processes global context using fully connected layers.

All branches are concatenated and passed through dense layers to generate a final regression output.

🧪 Ablation Study
We conduct a thorough ablation study to assess the contribution of each branch:

✅ full_model: All three branches (CNN + LSTM + Dense)

❌ model_without_A: Without CNN

❌ model_without_B: Without LSTM

❌ model_without_C: Without Dense

Each model is trained and evaluated independently to measure its Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a test set.

📊 Results
Full model Test MSE:             0.2091
Model without Branch A (CNN) MSE:  0.2293
Model without Branch B (LSTM) MSE: 0.2833
Model without Branch C (Dense) MSE:0.2725

These results demonstrate that each component plays a vital role in improving prediction accuracy.

📂 Dataset
